# Visual Debugger

This is a simple and interactive Python visual debugger built using React and Pyodide. This tool allows users to type Python code, execute it, and view the output in real-time, mimicking the behavior of Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started with Create React App


This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```shellscript
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

```shellscript
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for more information.
